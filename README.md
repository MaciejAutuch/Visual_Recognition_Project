# Visual_Recognition_Project
Project Done for a Class in AI and Machine Learning
In this project me along with 3 other colegues tackled the problem of facial mask recognition on pictures. We used a pretrained model in Tensorflow. I was responsible for the coding part while the other 3 for project management and writing. There are 4 notebooks, Pipeline for image processing, benchmarking with KNN model and 2 notebooks with final model making and evaluation. Lastly we added our own faces to test how good the model is.
